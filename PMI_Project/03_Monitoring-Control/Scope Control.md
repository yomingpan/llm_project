# Scope Control

## Purpose
The purpose of this document is to outline the strategies and processes for controlling the project scope throughout the project lifecycle. Effective scope control ensures that the project remains aligned with its objectives and that any changes to the scope are managed appropriately.

## Scope Control Process
1. **Define Scope Baseline**: Establish a clear scope baseline that includes the project scope statement, WBS, and WBS dictionary.
   
2. **Monitor Scope Changes**: Regularly review project deliverables and compare them against the scope baseline to identify any variances.

3. **Change Control Process**:
   - **Identify Changes**: Document any proposed changes to the project scope.
   - **Evaluate Changes**: Assess the impact of the proposed changes on project objectives, timelines, and costs.
   - **Approval Process**: Submit changes for approval to the change control board or designated authority.

4. **Communicate Changes**: Ensure that all stakeholders are informed of approved changes and their implications on the project.

5. **Update Documentation**: Revise project documents, including the scope statement and WBS, to reflect approved changes.

## Tools and Techniques
- **Change Control Software**: Utilize project management software to track changes and maintain documentation.
- **Regular Meetings**: Conduct regular meetings with the project team and stakeholders to discuss scope-related issues.

## Responsibilities
- **Project Manager**: Responsible for overseeing the scope control process and ensuring adherence to the change control procedures.
- **Project Team**: Responsible for identifying potential scope changes and communicating them to the project manager.

## Conclusion
Effective scope control is critical to the success of the project. By following the outlined processes and maintaining clear communication with stakeholders, the project team can manage scope changes effectively and keep the project on track.
