# Risk Response Plan

## Introduction
The Risk Response Plan outlines the strategies and actions to be taken in response to identified risks throughout the project lifecycle. It aims to minimize the impact of risks on project objectives.

## Risk Response Strategies
1. **Avoidance**: Change the project plan to eliminate the risk or protect the project objectives from its impact.
2. **Mitigation**: Take actions to reduce the probability of occurrence or impact of the risk.
3. **Transfer**: Shift the impact of a risk to a third party, such as through insurance or outsourcing.
4. **Acceptance**: Acknowledge the risk and decide to accept it without any proactive measures, often used for low-impact risks.

## Risk Response Actions
