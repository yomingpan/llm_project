# Qualitative Analysis of Project Risks

## Introduction
Qualitative risk analysis is a process used to prioritize risks based on their probability of occurrence and impact on project objectives. This document outlines the qualitative analysis of identified risks for the project.

## Risk Identification
- **Risk ID**: Unique identifier for each risk.
- **Risk Description**: A brief description of the risk.
- **Risk Category**: Classification of the risk (e.g., technical, external, organizational).

## Probability and Impact Assessment
- **Probability Scale**: 
  - 1 - Very Low
  - 2 - Low
  - 3 - Medium
  - 4 - High
  - 5 - Very High

- **Impact Scale**: 
  - 1 - Insignificant
  - 2 - Minor
  - 3 - Moderate
  - 4 - Major
  - 5 - Catastrophic

## Risk Matrix
| Risk ID | Risk Description | Probability | Impact | Risk Score (Probability x Impact) | Priority Level |
|---------|------------------|-------------|--------|------------------------------------|-----------------|
| R1      | Example Risk 1   | 4           | 3      | 12                                 | High            |
| R2      | Example Risk 2   | 2           | 5      | 10                                 | Medium          |
| R3      | Example Risk 3   | 1           | 2      | 2                                  | Low             |

## Conclusion
The qualitative analysis provides a framework for understanding the risks associated with the project. By prioritizing these risks, the project team can focus on developing appropriate risk response strategies.
